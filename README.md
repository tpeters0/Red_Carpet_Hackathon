Red Carpet Hackathon, Aug 29, 2015

Exercise done at Hackathon for DC Web Women and American Military Engineers

The assignment was to create a webpage for a Crittenton Services Event with the theme of 'Red Carpet Career', 
encouraging teenage girls to prepare for their future careers.

I worked with a partner, but she did not get me her finished files for the linked pages.  Some of her files are in the Red Carpet Your Career folder.

I created the main image from scratch in Adobe Illustrator.
